"""Experts read from the SSD as tokens ask for them, for a machine whose memory does not hold them all.

A token uses ten of a layer's 512 experts, and over a conversation they are not the same few (bench/expert_use.py),
so a small memory means reading from the disk all the time, and what matters is how. Here:

  * every expert in memory is three arrays of its own (its gate, up and down tensors, as the file's blocks), in
    one store shared by all layers, the least recently used dropped first when the budget is full;
  * a layer waits for its router's choice to reach the CPU (0.2 ms), reads what is missing with a few parallel
    reads past the page cache, and hands each (token, expert) pair's arrays to the kernels as they are;
  * a prompt, whose tokens use nearly every expert of a layer, reads the layer's three tensors whole instead, in
    file order, and keeps none of it;
  * at the start the budget is filled with the experts used most: by this machine's own answers so far, and
    before there are any, by a profile of seven conversations that comes with the engine (expert_use.npy).

Measured on the way, a token at a time on an M4 Max with nothing to read: 23 ms a pass with every expert in one
array; 34 with the wait at every layer; 42 if the ten experts are first joined into a stack, which is why the
kernels take them separately. Replacing one expert inside a 1.4 GB array copies the array (2 ms), which is why
each expert is its own array.
