"""Decoding with draft-and-verify, and a conversation that is read only once.

A step pushes a window of tokens through the trunk at once: the last token that is certain, then a few guesses
for the ones after it. The trunk's own choice after each row says whether the next guess was right; the run of
right guesses is kept, and the state is set to exactly what decoding those tokens one by one would have left.

What keeping a prefix of n of the window's T tokens takes, per kind of state:

    attention K/V and indexer keys   appended by the pass; drop the last T - n
    delta-net convolution history    a slice of the pass's convolution input
    delta-net recurrent state        the recurrence run again over the first n tokens, from inputs the pass kept
    n-gram convolution history       a slice, rebuilt from the state before and after the pass

The recurrent state cannot be cut back, so going back in a conversation needs a checkpoint: a copy of the small
states (113 MB) at a position. The attention caches are cut to that position, and reading resumes from there.
Checkpoints are taken while a prompt is read: before its last message boundaries and before its last token, which
is where a follow-up request usually parts from this one.
